      'The purpose of the store is to sell ecologically sustainable souvenirs that are manufactured in India.',
      'These products offer an easy and fun way for tourists to support local conservation efforts to protect and preserve Bandipur National Park and the animals in it.',
      'The wildlife souvenirs and locally produced handicrafts that you sell provide the local community with a source of income that is not dependant on the local wildlife.'

    p1: 'I have prepared two design directions for your new online store.',
    p2:
      'My goal for the first design option was to keep your conservation project and your online store as distinct, separate brands. This option centres around your artwork and is a clean, modern design.',
    p3:
      'The second option is a richer, warmer direction that aims to complement your conservation project. It uses a similar colour palette and builds on the design language used for the Mariamma Trust Website.',
    p5:
      'I have condensed my understanding of this project into the following points. Please correct them if I have misunderstood in any way. ',
    p6: `The following flowchart lays out the different pages I propose we include in the final website. If you would like to add or remove pages from the proposed architecture just let me know.`,
    p7: `This design centres around your artwork. The artwork photography is in a completely different league from any of the other product photographs I received. This design option accentuates the importance and prominence of your artwork and uses it to support Temple Tree's brand and mission.`,
    p8:
      'I have used a simple colour palette for this option. A card white background with a hint of texture to suggest a paper-like quality. I have also used two serif typefaces along with a clean, modern layout to suggest confidence and trust. My intention was to create a professional, art-centric online store, distinct from the Mariamma Trust.',
    p9:
      'This design direction takes a much warmer, friendlier, and more playful approach. I have built on the colour palette in Mariamma Trust website and added more layers and illustrations to make the tone more fun.',
    p10:
      'My intention with this option was to make it clear that the Trust and the online store belong to the same group. If we decide on this direction then it might make sense to merge the Trust and the store into a single website with a single, unified brand. You can still have two separate domains that take you to different areas of the site, but you will be able to look after and maintain the site from a single backend.',
    p11:
      'The website will take approximately 28 days to complete once a design direction has been decided. The cost of either option is $1500, of which $500 has already been paid.',
    p12:
      'For me to begin work, I need you to decide on a design direction. I will then design the rest of the pages for the website according to the chosen design direction. This includes the layout for tablet and mobile views. Once all the designs are complete then I can start developing the website.',
    p13:
      'Please take as long as you need to think through this. If anything was unclear, please email me and I will respond as soon as possible. I hope you enjoyed the proposal and thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this.'
